## ✅ V4.1.0 Major Release: UX Overhaul & Swiping

This release transforms the user experience from functional to fluid, focusing on speed and native mobile interaction.

### 🚀 Core Features

* **UI/UX Refresh:** The entire application interface has been updated for a sleeker, darker, and more modern look (OLED Aesthetic).
* **Mobile Gesture Support:** Recipes now support **swipe-to-action** (Swipe Right to **Favorite**, Swipe Left to **Delete**), massively accelerating list management.
* **New Utility: Share Function:** Added native mobile sharing support to quickly export clean recipe text.
* **Chef Mode (Generate):** Instantly create new recipes using natural language prompts and constraints.
* **AI Smart Parse:** Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to intelligently filter noise and structure text into clean JSON.
* **Persistent Rules:** Save custom constraints (e.g., "No spicy food," "must be low-carb") that the AI will enforce for all generated recipes.
* **100% Client-Side:** Zero servers, zero user tracking. All data is saved securely in your browser's local storage.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

* **Swipe Icon Feedback:** The visual feedback for the swipe actions needs polishing. The **Delete** side currently shows a strong red background but the icon visibility is poor, and the **Favorite** icon on the swipe overlay appears off-center or styled incorrectly. This is scheduled for the next minor release.
