### ⚠️ Current Status: Known Issue
*The application is fully functional, but please note:*

> **URL Extraction Bug:** Due to aggressive website anti-bot protection and noisy HTML, the main **"Extract with AI"** feature may fail or return empty results when using a URL.
>
> **Workaround:** Copy the ingredients and instructions text from the website and **paste it directly** into the input field. The core AI logic works instantly with text input.
